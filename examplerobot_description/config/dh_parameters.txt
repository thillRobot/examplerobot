Classical DH convention (Spong notation)
      ai di alphai thetai
DH = [0     300   -90   theta1 
      350   0     0     theta2
      0     0     -90   theta3
      0     300   90    theta4
      0     0     -90   theta5
      0     350   0     theta6]
      [0      250  0          -] last row is fixed offset to tool tip, not sure if this is needed

Modified DH convention (Craig notation)
    a(i-1) di   alpha(i-1) thetai
DH=[0      300  0          theta1
    0      0    90         theta2
    350    0    0          theta3
    0      300  90         theta4
    0      0    -90        theta5
    0      200  90         theta6]
   [0      250  0          -] last row is fixed offset to tool tip, could drop frame 7 here too

Unfortunately it seems like URDF and MOVEIT use the Modified DH convention. I amy be wrong.
